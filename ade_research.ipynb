        "\n",
        "2.  **Text Extraction (PaddleOCR):**\n",
        "    *   The input document first goes through a \"Text Extraction\" phase, utilizing \"PaddleOCR.\"\n",
        "    *   This component identifies and extracts text from the document.\n",
        "    *   It outputs \"Text Strings\" (the actual text), \"Bounding Boxes\" (coordinates indicating the location of each text string), and a \"Confidence Score\" (how certain the OCR is about the extracted text).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Region Detection (PaddleOCR LayoutDetect):**\n",
        "    *   In parallel with text extraction, the input document also undergoes \"Region Detection\" using \"PaddleOCR LayoutDetect.\"\n",
        "    *   This step identifies different types of regions within the document.\n",
        "    *   It detects \"Tables,\" \"Charts,\" and \"Text Blocks,\" categorizing the layout components.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Order Detection (LayoutReader):**\n",
        "    *   The \"Text Strings\" and \"Bounding Boxes\" from Text Extraction are then fed into \"Order Detection,\" which uses \"LayoutReader.\"\n",
        "    *   This component's purpose is to \"Determines reading order of text regions,\" ensuring that the extracted text can be read in a logical sequence, especially important for documents with complex layouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **LangChain Agent:**\n",
        "    *   All the processed information—ordered OCR text, layout region IDs and types, and tool descriptions—converges at the \"LangChain Agent.\" This agent acts as an intelligent orchestrator.\n",
